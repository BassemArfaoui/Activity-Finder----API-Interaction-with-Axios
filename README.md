# Activity Finder

## Overview

Activity Finder is a small web application built with Express.js, Node.js, and Axios. It demonstrates how to interact with APIs using Axios to perform different HTTP requests. The app generates random activities or allows users to filter activities based on type and number of participants. The activities are fetched from the [Bored API]([https://www.boredapi.com/](https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/)).

## Features

- **Random Activity Generation**: Get a random activity suggestion.
- **Filter Activities**: Search for activities by type and number of participants.
- **API Interaction**: Learn how to use Axios to make HTTP requests to external APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For building the frontend and styling the application.
